      Hi, I am <strong>Tran Cong Nguyen</strong>, a Web developer based in the Flower City of Vietnam.
    </p>

    <p>
      The turning point that made me study Information Technology was when my server was hacked by a developer I hired. I decided to become a developer myself to serve myself. Security, data integrity, and aesthetics are my top priorities.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a seasoned developer with 4 years of hands-on experience, I bring expertise in TypeScript, JavaScript, Vue, Node, Swift, and Dart to the table. My deep understanding of these technologies allows me to create efficient and user-friendly applications that meet client needs. I am dedicated to delivering top-quality work and continuously improving my skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am an enthusiastic traveler and advocate for the LGBTQ+ community. I enjoy coding, exploring new destinations, and making a positive impact on the world. I approach life with an open mind and a desire to make the most of every moment.
